Extract Data from VUE/ .vrl files

# VUE FILES
To extract specific columns from .vrl files used in VUE (a 3D environment software), you can use PowerShell to parse and extract data. 
However, since .vrl files are typically custom-formatted files used by VUE and may not have a standard structure, you will need to adapt the script based on the specific format of your .vrl files.

For this example, let’s assume .vrl files are text-based and contain data separated by a delimiter (such as a comma or space) and that you want to extract two specific columns. Here’s a PowerShell script to help with this task:

## PowerShell Script to Extract Columns from .vrl Files
* Identify the delimiter used in your .vrl files (e.g., comma, space, tab).
* Determine the column indices you want to extract.

### Here’s a sample script that extracts data from two columns of a .vrl file. This example assumes a comma delimiter, but you can adjust the delimiter as needed.
